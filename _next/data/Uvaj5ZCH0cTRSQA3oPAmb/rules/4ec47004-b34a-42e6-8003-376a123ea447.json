Linux systems contain several default MOTD files located in the \"/etc/update-motd.d/\" and \n\"/usr/lib/update-notifier/\" directories. These scripts run as the root user every time a user connects over SSH or a \nserial connection. Adversaries may create malicious MOTD files that grant them persistence onto the target every time a \nuser connects to the system by executing a backdoor script or command.
